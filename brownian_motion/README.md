# brownian-motion

See brownian.ipynb for overview

This is a loose translation into python of my KCL second year numerical modelling project (from code supplied in Fortan). The code uses a Velocity-Verlet integrator to simulate the Brownian motion of a number of particles in solution (see parameters).

brownian.py executes the code used in brownian.ipynb, brownian_model.py contains the class BrownianModel2D used. 

A representative trajectory plot is also included.
