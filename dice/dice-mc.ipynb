    "Playing poker dice suggested a question I couldn't answer using probability techniques from A Level Statistics: what is the expectation value for the number of rolls required it would take to get all sixes from five dice, if at each round sixes are reserved (i.e. without replacement).\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation value for the maximum time to first event for five concurrent poisson processes would be easy to calculate, but the same technique cannot be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've since found how to calculate the answer without having to estimate it from a Monte Carlo simulation so I have added that method as a check/comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried to make the functions as general as possible. First we calculate the transition probability between numbers of sixes, then at each stage of a particular trial use these to calculate cumulative probabilities for all possible events resulting from the next roll. A random number on [0,1] is used to determine which event is carried out. The process is continued until the conclusion of each trial, and repeated for a set number of trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results from each trial are stored and used to calculate a mean and standard error, which are compared with the answer obtained from calculation via the transition matrix - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbing_Markov_chain."

As seen above, simulation results are consistent with the solution via the transition matrix - although both use the same method for calculating transition probabilities and so are not independent. Printing this matrix it is possible to check individual probabilities with a calculator and they are as expected."
